## What's SnakeTypes?
It's a snake game. However, this time, rather than using standard controls, the snake is now controlled by typing words quickly. meaning you have to type fast enough to make the snake turn in time! This not only provides entertainment, but also enhances your wpm(words per minute) and expands your vocabulary in an interactive way.

### How to run?
- Step 1: Delete node modules if exists : `rm -R node_modules`
- Step 2: run: `npm install`
- Step 3: run : `npm start`
